                                                Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of
                                                people, a
                                                place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of
                                                knowledge about
                                                how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about
                                                disease and
                                                death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.

                                                Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards

                                                This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province,
                                                China. The
                                                first infections were linked to a live animal market, but
                                                the virus is
                                                now spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note
                                                that
                                                person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some
                                                viruses are
                                                highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are
                                                less so.

                                                The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily
                                                and
                                                sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some
                                                affected
                                                geographic areas. Community spread means people have been
                                                infected with
                                                the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or
                                                where they
                                                became infected.

                                                person-to-person.
                                                Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the
                                                illness to
                                                others. That is why CDC recommends that these patients be
                                                isolated
                                                either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick
                                                they are) until
                                                they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting
                                                others.

                                                How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision
                                                on when to
                                                release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case
                                                basis in
                                                consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control
                                                experts, and
                                                public health officials and involves considering specifics
                                                of each
                                                situation including disease severity, illness signs and
                                                symptoms, and
                                                results of laboratory testing for that patient.

                                                Current CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone
                                                from isolation
                                                is made on a case by case basis and includes meeting all of
                                                the
                                                following requirements:

                                                The patient is free from fever without the use of
                                                fever-reducing
                                                medications.

                                                The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.

                                                The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive
                                                respiratory
                                                specimens collected at least 24 hours apart.

                                                Someone who has been released from isolation is not
                                                considered to pose a
                                                risk of infection to others.

                                                Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from
                                                person-to-person
                                                through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence
                                                to support
                                                transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before
                                                preparing or
                                                eating food it is important to always wash your hands with
                                                soap and
                                                water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the
                                                day wash
                                                your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or
                                                going to
                                                the bathroom.

                                                It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by
                                                touching a surface
                                                or object that has the virus on it and then touching their
                                                own mouth,
                                                nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be
                                                the main way
                                                the virus spreads.

                                                In general, because of poor survivability of these

                                                surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food
                                                products or
                                                packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at

                                                authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases
                                                of COVID-19

                                                countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their
                                                outbreaks.
                                                However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly

                                                latest news.

                                                You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading
                                                COVID-19 by
                                                taking some simple precautions:

                                                Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an
                                                alcohol-based hand rub
                                                or wash them with soap and water.

                                                Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using
                                                alcohol-based hand
                                                rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.


                                                Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself
                                                and anyone
                                                who is coughing or sneezing.

                                                Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid
                                                droplets
                                                from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are
                                                too close,
                                                you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19
                                                virus if the
                                                person coughing has the disease.


                                                Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.

                                                Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once
                                                contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,
                                                nose or mouth.
                                                From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you
                                                sick.


                                                Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good
                                                respiratory
                                                hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your
                                                bent elbow or
                                                tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used
                                                tissue
                                                immediately.

                                                Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory
                                                hygiene you
                                                protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu
                                                and
                                                COVID-19.


                                                Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and
                                                difficulty
                                                breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.
                                                Follow the
                                                directions of your local health authority.

                                                Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to
                                                date
                                                information on the situation in your area. Calling in
                                                advance will allow
                                                your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right
                                                health
                                                facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread

                                                Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or
                                                local areas
                                                where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid
                                                traveling to
                                                places – especially if you are an older person or have
                                                diabetes, heart

                                                Close contacts should also follow these recommendations:

                                                Make sure that you understand and can help the patient
                                                follow their
                                                healthcare provider’s instructions for medication(s) and
                                                care. You
                                                should help the patient with basic needs in the home and
                                                provide support
                                                for getting groceries, prescriptions, and other personal
                                                needs.


                                                Monitor the patient’s symptoms. If the patient is getting
                                                sicker, call
                                                his or her healthcare provider and tell them that the
                                                patient has
                                                laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This will help the healthcare

                                                the local or
                                                state health department for additional guidance. If the
                                                patient has a
                                                medical emergency and you need to call 911, notify the
                                                dispatch
                                                personnel that the patient has, or is being evaluated for
                                                COVID-19.


                                                Household members should stay in another room or be
                                                separated from the
                                                patient as much as possible. Household members should use a
                                                separate
                                                bedroom and bathroom, if available.


                                                Prohibit visitors who do not have an essential need to be in
                                                the home.


                                                Household members should care for any pets in the home. Do
                                                not handle
                                                pets or other animals while sick. For more information, see
                                                COVID-19 and
                                                Animals.


                                                Make sure that shared spaces in the home have good air flow,
                                                such as by
                                                an air conditioner or an opened window, weather permitting.


                                                Perform hand hygiene frequently. Wash your hands often with
                                                soap and
                                                water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand
                                                sanitizer
                                                that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of
                                                your hands and
                                                rubbing them together until they feel dry. Soap and water
                                                should be used
                                                preferentially if hands are visibly dirty.


                                                Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed
                                                hands.


                                                The patient should wear a facemask when you are around other
                                                people. If
                                                the patient is not able to wear a facemask (for example,
                                                because it
                                                causes trouble breathing), you, as the caregiver, should
                                                wear a mask
                                                when you are in the same room as the patient.


                                                Wear a disposable facemask and gloves when you touch or have
                                                contact
                                                with the patient’s blood, stool, or body fluids, such as
                                                saliva, sputum,
                                                nasal mucus, vomit, urine.

                                                Throw out disposable facemasks and gloves after using them.
                                                Do not
                                                reuse.


                                                When removing personal protective equipment, first remove
                                                and dispose of
                                                gloves. Then, immediately clean your hands with soap and
                                                water or
                                                alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Next, remove and dispose of
                                                facemask, and
                                                immediately clean your hands again with soap and water or
                                                alcohol-based
                                                hand sanitizer.


                                                Avoid sharing household items with the patient. You should
                                                not share
                                                dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels,
                                                bedding, or
                                                other items. After the patient uses these items, you should
                                                wash them
                                                thoroughly (see below “Wash laundry thoroughly”).


                                                Clean all “high-touch” surfaces, such as counters,
                                                tabletops, doorknobs,
                                                bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and
                                                bedside
                                                tables, every day. Also, clean any surfaces that may have
                                                blood, stool,
                                                or body fluids on them.

                                                Use a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the
                                                label
                                                instructions. Labels contain instructions for safe and
                                                effective use of
                                                the cleaning product including precautions you should take
                                                when applying
                                                the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure you have
                                                good
                                                ventilation during use of the product.


                                                Wash laundry thoroughly.

                                                Immediately remove and wash clothes or bedding that have
                                                blood, stool,
                                                or body fluids on them.


                                                Wear disposable gloves while handling soiled items and keep
                                                soiled items

                                                Follow the steps below:

                                                Protect yourself and others.

                                                Stay home if you are sick. Keep away from people who are
                                                sick. Limit
                                                close contact with others as much as possible (about 6
                                                feet).

                                                Put your household plan into action.

                                                Stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation. Be aware
                                                of temporary
                                                school dismissals in your area, as this may affect your

                                                daily routine.

                                                Continue practicing everyday preventive actions. Cover

                                                at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available,
                                                use a hand
                                                sanitizer that contains 60% alcohol. Clean frequently
                                                touched surfaces
                                                and objects daily using a regular household detergent and
                                                water.

                                                Notify your workplace as soon as possible if your regular
